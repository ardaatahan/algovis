# ALGOVIS
Algovis is a website built with React that allows the user to visualize various sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort) and gain insights about how these algorithms actually work under the hood.

The deployed site can be accessed here: https://ardaatahan.github.io/algovis/

Algovis enables the users to do the following:
  - Select from a variety of sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort)
  - Adjust the size of the array that is sorted
  - Adjust the speed of the animation
  - Generate a new random array and visualize the values as bars (the length of the bars are adjusted in accordance to the corresponding integer value in the array)
  - See which values in the array are compared and changed as the algorithm sorts

I was inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu for this project. I also took inspiration from a GitHub user by the name "tlylt" for the implementation of the algorithms.
